''' youâ€™ll need to make sure you include at least one of those methods in your class definition. If you have to pick one, go with __repr__() because it can be used in place of __str__().

The string returned by __str__() is the informal string representation of an object and should be readable. The string returned by __repr__() is the official representation and should be unambiguous. Calling str() and repr() is preferable to using __str__() and __repr__() directly.

By default, f-strings will use __str__(), but you can make sure they use __repr__() if you include the conversion flag !r:'''
